#' @title  Rice data for Example 3
#' @description
#' (Gomez & Gomez, 1984, p. 401): Nitrogen uptake (g/pot) of rice was studied in a two-factor
#' greenhouse experiment involving duration of water stress (W) and level of nitrogen application (N).
#' The experiment had four water-stress levels (0, 10, 20 and 40 days) as main-plot treatments and
#' four nitrogen rates (0, 90, 180 and 270 kg/ha) as sub-plot treatments. The main plots were
#' randomized in four complete blocks.
