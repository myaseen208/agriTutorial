#' @title  Example 1: Split-plot design with one qualitative and one quantitative level factor
#' @description
#' Gomez & Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three management practices
#' (minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer
#' (0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3). The experiment
#' involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and nitrogen
#' fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, there were 45 treatments with
#' three replicates in complete replicate blocks. The fertilizer treatments were applied
#'  to main plots, the management practices to split-plots and the varieties to split-split-plots.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Section 1
#'
#' Section 1 examines treatment effects by fitting qualitative factorial models and the first analysis
#' calculates a full analysis of variance (Table 1) for main plots (nitrogen),
#' split-plots (management) and split-split-plots (variety). Each type of experimental unit (or "stratum")
#' requires a separate error term in the fitted analysis.
#'
#' The second analysis (Table 2) uses a REML mixed model analysis to find treatment means and SE's for each marginal
#' treatment classification averaged over all the other treatment factors, together with estimates of
#' pairwise contrasts of treatment means and the SE's of the pairwise treatment comparisons. This analysis fits
#' the full set of nitrogen-by-variety interaction effects assuming additive management effects and the fit of the model
#' is tested by a graphical plot of the model residuals.
#' Residual plots provide an important check on model assumptions but many more options for model testing are
#' available and further methods for diagnostic testing are examined in the subsequent examples.
#'
#' The third analysis (Table 3) shows a mixed model analysis of the full factorial model fitted by REML using the
#' lmer function of the lme4 package. Generally with mixed models, determination of the denominator degrees of
#' freedom for Wald-type F- and t-statistics becomes an issue, and here we use the method proposed by
#' Kenward & Roger (1997).
#'
#' Section 2
#'
#' Section 2 examines treatment effects by fitting polynomial models and the first step calculates
#' a full set of four raw polynomials for the 5-levels of N using the poly() function.
#' The N rates are re-scaled by division by 100 to improve numerical stability.
#'
#' The second step fits a mixed model polynomial analysis of nitrogen effects assuming additive management effects (Table 7).
#' In this analysis, most of the nitrogen treatment effect can be explained by linear and quadratic trend effects.
#' but it is important to note that there is a non-negligible Variety x Cubic N interaction effect. This suggests
#' that not all the varieties responded in a similar way to the N treatments and that some further analysis of the
#' data may be required (see also the N plots of individual varieties and replicates in Fig 1).
#'
#' The third step fits the required model for the actual fitted model coefficients (Table 8).
#' When estimating model effects, only effects that are significant for the fitted model or that are marginal to
#' those effects (functional marginality) should be included in the model therefore only linear and quadratic nitrogen effects
#' are included in this model. The fitted model for the nitrogen effects fits the actual actual nitrogen levels used
#' in the experiment therefore this model provides the required coefficients for the actual applied nitrogen levels.
#'
#' Section 3
#'
#' Section 3 provides checks on some of the assumptions underlying the blocks-by-treatments model.
#'
#' The first analysis in this section shows a
#' complete partition of the blocks-by-treatments interaction effects into factorial mean square terms where
#' all the terms that contain a replicate:variety interaction effect are estimates of the split-split-plot error variance.
#' If the blocks-by-treatments assumptions are valid, all the estimates of the split-split-plot error variance
#' are expected to have
#' the same error mean square. However, the Replicate:variety effect has a mean square of 1.54 on 4 degrees
#' of freedom whereas the Replicate:management:variety:nitrogen effect has a mean square of 0.26 on 32 degrees of freedom.
#' The ratio of these mean squares is 5.92 with an F-probability of 0.00110 on 4 and 32 degrees of freedom, which
#' means that the Replicate:variety interaction effect is significantly inflated relative to the
#' Replicate:management:variety:nitrogen effect. This shows that the assumptions underlying the blocks-by-treatments
#' analysis of the model are invalid with a high level of probability.
#'
#' The 4 degrees of freedom in the Replicate:variety interaction effect are the differences between the three varieties
#' differenced between the three replicate blocks. Fig S1 shows graphical plots of
#' variety effects in each replicate block averaged over management effects, and there is clear evidence that the effects of
#' Variety 1 in blocks 1 and 2 were different from the effects of Variety 1 in block 3.
#'
#' The second analysis in Section 3 shows a complete partition of the blocks-by-treatments
#' interaction effects into factorial mean square terms ignoring Variety 1. This
#' analysis shows a reasonably good fit to the assumed additive block which
#' supports the hypothesis that the non-additivity of the block-and-treatment effects in the
#' full unrestricted analysis is mainly due to Variety 1.
#'
#' The final analysis in Section 3 shows an analysis of variance of the treatment effects ignoring Variety 1.
#' In this analysis, the management:variety interaction effect becomes significant at the 0.00992 probability level
#' compared with a non-significant management:variety interaction effect in the analysis of the full data set.
#'
#' Such anomalies are not uncommon in the analysis of real data sets and it is the task of
#' the statistician to identify anomalies as and when they occur. Factorial designs can be very powerful for practical
#' research but, as demonstrated with this data set, the analysis of such designs is complex and anomalies
#' can be easily missed.
#' Unless an anomaly is due to an easily identified cause such as an incorrectly recorded data point, it is likely
#' that the anomaly will need to be investigated by further discussion with the research workers.
#' It is a mistake to suppose that data from a designed experiment can be analysed statistically in isolation from
#' the research workers who conducted the experiment.
