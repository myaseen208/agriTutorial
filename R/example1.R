#' @title   Example 1: Split-plot design with one qualitative and one quantitative level factor
#' @name    example1
#' @aliases example1
#' @description Gomez & Gomez (1984, p. 143) report a rice experiment with three 
#'              management practices (minimum, optimum, intensive), five different amounts of
#'              nitrogen (N) fertilizer (0, 50, 80, 110, 140 kg/ha), and three varieties (V1, V2, V3).
#'              The experiment involved variety and management as qualitative treatment factors and 
#'              nitrogen fertilizer as a quantitative treatment factor. Overall, 
#'              there were 45 treatments with three replicates in complete replicate blocks. 
#'              The fertilizer treatments were applied to main plots, the management practices to 
#'              split-plots and the varieties to split-split-plots.
#'
#' @details 
#' Section 1
#' Section 1 examines treatment effects by fitting qualitative factorial models and 
#' the first analysis calculates a full analysis of variance (Table 1) for 
#' main plots (nitrogen), split-plots (management) and split-split-plots (variety). 
#' Each type of experimental unit (or "stratum") requires a separate error term in 
#' the fitted analysis.
#' 
#' The second analysis (Table 2) uses a REML mixed model analysis to find treatment means 
#' and SE's for each marginal treatment classification averaged over all the 
#' other treatment factors, together with estimates of pairwise contrasts of 
#' treatment means and the SE's of the pairwise treatment comparisons. 
#' This analysis fits the full set of nitrogen-by-variety interaction effects 
#' assuming additive management effects and the fit of the model is tested by 
#' a graphical plot of the model residuals. Residual plots provide an important 
#' check on model assumptions but many more options for model testing are 
#' available and further methods for diagnostic testing are examined in the 
#' subsequent examples.
#' 
#' The third analysis (Table 3) shows a mixed model analysis of the full factorial model 
#' fitted by REML using the lmer function of the lme4 package. Generally with 
#' mixed models, determination of the denominator degrees of freedom for 
#' Wald-type F- and t-statistics becomes an issue, and here we use the 
#' method proposed by Kenward & Roger (1997).
#' 
#' Section 2
#' Section 2 examines treatment effects by fitting polynomial models and 
#' the first step calculates a full set of four raw polynomials for the 
#' 5-levels of N using the poly() function. The N rates are re-scaled by 
#' division by 100 to improve numerical stability.
#' 
#' The second step fits a mixed model polynomial analysis of nitrogen effects 
#' assuming additive management effects (Table 7). In this analysis, 
#' most of the nitrogen treatment effect can be explained by linear and 
#' quadratic trend effects. but it is important to note that there is a 
#' non-negligible Variety x Cubic N interaction effect. This suggests 
#' that not all the varieties responded in a similar way to the N treatments 
#' and that some further analysis of the data may be required 
#' (see also the N plots of individual varieties and replicates in Fig 1).
#' 
#' The third step fits the required model for the actual fitted model coefficients 
#' (Table 8). When estimating model effects, only effects that are significant for 
#' the fitted model or that are marginal to those effects (functional marginality) 
#' should be included in the model therefore only linear and quadratic nitrogen effects 
#' are included in this model. The fitted model for the nitrogen effects fits the actual 
#' actual nitrogen levels used in the experiment therefore this model provides the 
#' required coefficients for the actual applied nitrogen levels.
#' 
#' 
#' Section 3
#' 
#' Section 3 provides checks on some of the assumptions underlying 
#' the blocks-by-treatments model.
#' 
#' The first analysis in this section shows a complete partition of 
#' the blocks-by-treatments interaction effects into factorial mean 
#' square terms where all the terms that contain a replicate:variety 
#' interaction effect are estimates of the split-split-plot error 
#' variance. If the blocks-by-treatments assumptions are valid, 
#' all the estimates of the split-split-plot error variance are 
#' expected to have the same error mean square. However, 
#' the Replicate:variety effect has a mean square of 1.54 on 4 
#' degrees of freedom whereas the Replicate:management:variety:nitrogen 
#' effect has a mean square of 0.26 on 32 degrees of freedom. 
#' The ratio of these mean squares is 5.92 with an F-probability of 
#' 0.00110 on 4 and 32 degrees of freedom, which means that the 
#' Replicate:variety interaction effect is significantly inflated 
#' relative to the Replicate:management:variety:nitrogen effect. 
#' This shows that the assumptions underlying the blocks-by-treatments 
#' analysis of the model are invalid with a high level of probability.
#' 
#' The 4 degrees of freedom in the Replicate:variety interaction 
#' effect are the differences between the three varieties differenced 
#' between the three replicate blocks. Fig S1 shows graphical plots 
#' of variety effects in each replicate block averaged over management 
#' effects, and there is clear evidence that the effects of Variety 1 
#' in blocks 1 and 2 were different from the effects of Variety 1 in 
#' block 3.
#' 
#' The second analysis in Section 3 shows a complete partition of the 
#' blocks-by-treatments interaction effects into factorial mean square 
#' terms ignoring Variety 1. This analysis shows a reasonably good fit 
#' to the assumed additive block which supports the hypothesis that 
#' the non-additivity of the block-and-treatment effects in the full 
#' unrestricted analysis is mainly due to Variety 1.
#' 
#' The final analysis in Section 3 shows an analysis of variance of 
#' the treatment effects ignoring Variety 1. In this analysis, 
#' the management:variety interaction effect becomes significant at 
#' the 0.00992 probability level compared with a non-significant 
#' management:variety interaction effect in the analysis of the 
#' full data set.
#' 
#' Such anomalies are not uncommon in the analysis of real data sets 
#' and it is the task of the statistician to identify anomalies as 
#' and when they occur. Factorial designs can be very powerful for 
#' practical research but, as demonstrated with this data set, 
#' the analysis of such designs is complex and anomalies can be 
#' easily missed. Unless an anomaly is due to an easily identified 
#' cause such as an incorrectly recorded data point, it is likely 
#' that the anomaly will need to be investigated by further 
#' discussion with the research workers. It is a mistake to suppose 
#' that data from a designed experiment can be analysed statistically 
#' in isolation from the research workers who conducted the experiment.
