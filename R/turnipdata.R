#' @title Turnip data for Example 5
#' @description
#' Mead (1988, p. 323) describes an experiment on spacing effects with turnips,
#' which was laid out in three complete blocks. Five different seed rates
#' (0.5, 2, 8, 20, 32 lb/acre) were tested in combination with four row widths
#' (4, 8, 16, 32 inches), giving rise to a total of 20 treatments.
#' Turnip yields (in lb per plot) were logarithmically transformed for
#' analysis because this stabilized the variance (Mead, 1988; also see Figure 12).
