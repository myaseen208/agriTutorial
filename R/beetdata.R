#' Petersen (1994, p. 125) describes an experiment conducted to assess the effects
#' of five different quantities of N-fertiliser (0, 35, 70, 105 and 140 kg N/ha) on root dry
#' matter yield of sugar beets (t/ha) with three complete replications laid out in three
#' randomized complete blocks. One objective of this experiment is to determine the amount
#' of fertilizer maximizing yield.
