#' @title  Example 4: One qualitative treatment factor with repeated measurements over time.
#'
#' @description
#' Milliken & Johnson (1992, p. 429) discuss data which they describe as repeated leaf index measurements
#' on sorghum. Their data set comprises five replicate blocks of four sorghum varieties and they assume equally spaced
#' repeated measurements on each plot in each block on five consecutive occasions starting two weeks after emergence.
#' No further information is given but it appears that the data is simulated or made-up rather than real.
#' Although real data is more authentic, it can sometimes be useful to discuss the analysis of an example data set
#' from the literature, even when the data is simulated. Milliken & Johnson discuss multivariate analysis
#' of variance of the data but this method take no account of the ordered relationship between repeated
#' observations or the likely correlation structure of the data and we will discuss alternative correlation models
#' that are specifically intended to account for the underlying structure of repeated measures data. The interested
#' reader can, if desired, refer to Milliken & Johnson (1992) Chapter 31 for comparison of the
#' different approaches.
#'
#' @details
#' \strong{Section 1} calculates polynomials for weeks and blocks using the \code{poly()} function.
#' Two sets of polynomials for weeks, raw and orthogonal, are calculated and saved as \code{sorghum$rawWeeks}
#' and \code{sorghum$polWeeks} respectively. Orthogonal polynomials for blocks are calculated and saved as
#' \code{sorghum$polBlocks}. It is important to note that the \code{poly()} function calculates all polynomial
#' contrasts up to the required degree but does NOT include the zero-degree polynomial.
#' Additionally, the block variable \code{varblock} is saved as a factor \code{factblock}.
#'
#' \strong{Section 2} compares five different correlation structures for the repeated measures analysis
#' using the gls() function of the nlme package. Each analysis fits a full factorial model for the variety-by-weeks and
#' blocks-by-weeks effects assuming block and treatment additivity. The goodness of fit of the five models is
#' compared by AIC statistics where the smaller the AIC the better the fit. Here, the AR(1)+nugget model fitted
#' by the \code{corExp()} function gave the best fitting model. See \code{help(corExp)}for further information about
#' the corExp() function. Note that \code{corSymm} represents a general correlation structure and will, presumably, give
#' an analysis similar to a multivariate analysis of variance. Although this structure appears to give the best fit according to the
#' negative log likelihood statistic, this
#' criterion takes no account of the number of estimated variance parameters p in the variance model which, in the case of the
#' \code{corSymm} model, is p = 15, compared to only p = 2 for the AR(1) model. When assessed by the AIC statistic, the
#' \code{corSymm} model gave the least good fit of any of the non-null correlation structures which is strong evidence that the
#' multivariate analysis of variance method discussed by Milliken & Johnson (1992) will lack power.
#'
#' \strong{Section 3} fits a full regression model over the five weeks of repeated measures and tests for possible
#' variety and variety-by-weeks interactions effects. The weeks factor is decomposed into individual
#' polynomial contrasts (see Table A2 and Table 14) to test the significance of each individual variety-by-weeks polynomial
#'  effect.
#' The analysis of polynomial contrasts shows that the variety-by-weeks interaction is due mainly to the
#' degree-1 = \code{variety:rawWeeks[,1]} and the
#' degree-2 = \code{variety:rawWeeks[,2]} effects, although there is also some evidence
#' of higher-degree variety-by-weeks interaction effects. The analysis also shows the \code{corExp()} range and
#' nugget statistics for the full fitted model and these are used to calculate the correlation coefficient
#' usingthe formula \code{rho=(1-nugget)*exp(-1/range)}. Note that this formula is different from the the formula used in
#' Tables A1 and A2 and will give a different value of \code{rho}: see \code{help(corExp)}.
#'
#' \strong{Section 4} fits a quadratic regression model for weeks assuming the degree-3 and degree-4 polynomial week effects are zero.
#' The average effects of blocks are fitted by \code{polBlocks} and the interactions between the blocks and the weeks are fitted
#' by \code{polBlocks:(rawWeeks[,1] + rawWeeks[,2] + polWeeks[,3]+ polWeeks[,4])}. The \code{gls()} algorithm requires the same
#' polynomial weeks contrasts in both the blocks and the varieties models which is why raw degree-1 and degree-2 weeks contrasts have been
#' used for the blocks-by-weeks interaction model. However, orthogonal polynomials have better numerical stability than raw polynomials so
#'  orthogonal polynomial contrasts have been used for the degree-3 and degree-4 weeks contrasts.
#' The summary analysis shows all variety effects as differences from
#' the intercept which, in this analysis, is variety 1 therefore all model effects in Table 15 can be derived by
#' adding appropriate effects to the intercept. If SED's are required, these must be calculated from the
#' variance/covariance matrix which can be extracted by the code \code{vcov()}. Using this matrix, the SED for variety differences was
#' calculated to be 0.172, the SED for the variety-by-linear weeks slope parameters was calculated to be 0.117 and the SED
#' for the variety-by-quadratic weeks slope parameters was calculated to be 0.0192. These estimates are approximately 2-3 percent
#' larger than those shown in Table 15 but it is not clear if the discrepancies are due to the model specification or to a
#' difference between the R and the SAS software. Possibly the implementation of the Kenward-Roger method of adjusting
#' the denominator d.f. and the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the estimated fixed effects might be different for the two
#' algorithms. The range, nugget and correlation coefficient are extracted and displayed and a
#' graphical plot of the studentized residuals from the quadratic regression model is also shown.
#'
#' \strong{Section 5} fits a quadratic regression model for variety-by-week interaction effects assuming
#' a full degree-4 polynomial model for weeks and blocks-by-weeks effects.
#' The quadratic regression model in Section 4 corresponds to the regression model used for Tables 14 and 15 of Piepho and Edmondson (2018)
#' but the range = 3397131013 and nugget = 0.4605535 of this model are very different from the range = 10.35774 and nugget = 0.1720444 of the
#' full factorial model. As there is  evidence from Table A2 that the degree-3 and degree-4 polynomial
#' weeks effects are non-negligible, the quadratic model for weeks effects in Section 4 may be inadequate for the data and the model
#' may be underfitted. In this section, the assumption that the degree-3 and degree-4 polynomial weeks effects are zero is relaxed and
#' a full degree-4 model for weeks and block-by-weeks interaction effects is fitted. The fitted model for treatment effects needs to be
#'  as parsimonious as possible to ensure that estimates
#' of treatment effects are robust against model assumptions and a degree-2 regression model for variety-by-weeks effects
#' appears to be the most appropriate treatment model for this data. With this model, the values of the auto-correlation parameters
#'  are: range = 42.75763, nugget = 0.3586337 and
#' correlation = 0.6265403 which are much closer to the autocorrelation parameters from the full factorial model than are those from
#' Section 4. As the model fits the full polynomial weeks model, it is not necessary to use polynomial blocks contrasts which gives a substantial
#' simplification in coding.
#'
#' \strong{Comment} The model fitted in Section 5 appears to be the best model available based on the generalized least squares method but
#'  it is clear from the graphical plots of studentized residuals that the fitted data contains outliers that are not
#' well accommodated by the fitted model. If the data was from a real experiment, further information about the data might be available but as the data
#' seems to be artificial this option is not available. In this situation, various robust methods of model fitting or regression analysis
#' that can accommodate non-standard distributions or model outliers are available. However, these methods are beyond the scope of
#' this tutorial and will not be discussed further here.
