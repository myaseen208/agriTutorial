## Description

Example software for the analysis of data from designed experiments,
especially agricultural crop experiments. The basics of the analysis of
designed experiments are discussed using real examples from agricultural
field trials. A range of statistical methods using a range of R
statistical packages are exemplified . The experimental data is made
available as separate data sets for each example and the R analysis code
is made available as example code. The example code can be readily
extended, as required.
